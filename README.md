# ICSI333_p5
There are two separate MAL(Mips Assembly Language) files


Because this projct contains two seperate MIPS programs, this readme will be seperated into two sections.

Program 1:

This program will prompt the user to enter an integer(positive or negative). If the entered number is negative it will output the number of leading 1s. If the entered number is positive it will output the number of leading 0s. Note that this is based on the idea that an integer is 32 bits, as such your output can only be as large as 32(32 1s if the number is -1 or 32 0s if the number is 0).
--------------------------------------------------------------
Program 2:

This is a program that will accept an input string of size 81 and a pattern string of size 11. It will check if the given pattern is within the given string and if it is it will print the index where the first instance occurs. Notice that multiple instances are ignored, only the first instance is checked. If there is a partial match, then the length of the longest partial match is given along with the starting index. Note that indexes start at 0.
